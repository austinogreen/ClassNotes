Sorting
	In place sorting
		does not require any extra working storage
		Useful for large amounts
	Internal Sorting
		all keys kept in main mem
		Counting
			Determine rank of key k
			Can iterate over all keys
			Compare to all keys but itself (N^2 - N)
			Compare 2 keys and increment larger one
		Insertion
			Compare right to left, moving to its correct slot
			One iteration gets one element in right place
			Start with index 1, because don't need to compare item 0 with itself
			Can do binary search on sorted part of the list
			Both have O(n^2) data movements
			But binary insertion sort has O(nlogn) vs. O(n^2) comparisons for regular
		Exchanges
		Merging (Merge sort)
		Distribution (Radix sort)
		(Only first 4 on 1st exam)
