Adaptive Sort
	Checks to see if elements are sorted first
	p-sorted - all pairs of keys in position i & j, j - i <= p
		Gives an estimation of how nearly an array is sorted
		0-sorted is completely sorted
		1-sorted is only unsorted in elements next to each other
	p-sorted completity is O(Nlogp)
	p can be at most N -> maximum complexity is NlogN
	when p is small -> linear time sorted
	Split keys into odds and evens
		Recursively sort
		p is number of splits
	Print Complexity Chart
	Stable means that original order is preserved if they keys are the same
	Inplace doesn't require addional space
Shell Sort
	Shift the list a lot, then recersively shorter until sorted
	Don't compare items next to each other but in some increment
		This is called (increment)-sort
	Then we can call 1-sort (insertion sort)
	Want to do a N-sort, depends on the size of the array
		N is gap/interval size
	Knuth gap sequence
		start with h=1
		h = 3*h +1 
		until gap larger than the array
	Complexity is complicated
